 Get to know the MINDBODY API
            Our Application Programming Interface (API) allows developers to pull information from the MINDBODY software and use it to create a variety of applications across multiple virtual platforms. This ability offers clients the option of adding functionality to their services through mobile applications, websites and any other digital space.
The MINDBODY API uses Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to grant access to MINDBODY client databases. This allows developers to use web services to return XML-formatted documents with the resulting data, (i.e., prices, location, features). Because the data is returned in a standardized format, it can then be integrated directly into a third-party website or application.
