<h2>Get to know the MINDBODY API</h2>
<p>Our Application Programming Interface (API) allows developers to pull information from the MINDBODY software and use it to create a variety of applications across multiple virtual platforms. This ability offers clients the option of adding functionality to their services through mobile applications, websites and any other digital space.</p>
<p>The MINDBODY API uses Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to grant access to MINDBODY client databases. This allows developers to use web services to return XML-formatted documents with the resulting data, (i.e., prices, location, features). Because the data is returned in a standardized format, it can then be integrated directly into a third-party website or application.</p>
